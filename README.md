# About TimeX
- If you disable the "PlayInLoop" option, TimeX will act as a timer, otherwise it will run in "work - break" mode.
- The "work - break" mode counts down the work time, and then activates the alarm. If the user turns off the alarm, it counts down the break time and then activates the alarm again. The whole process repeats itself.
- Double-click the "Off alarm" button while the alarm is on to skip the pause time.
- The TimeX, after being minimized, resides in the system tray.
